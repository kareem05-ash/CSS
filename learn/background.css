/*                                  Background
    1. background-color: color can be accessed by 3 methods
        1. by typing its name e.g., red / green / blue / black / purple
        2. by **RGB** function: (Red Green Blu) function. Each can take values from 0 to 255
            e.g., background-color: rbg(255 0 0) => this is the red color. red ratio: 255, green and blue ration: 0
            e.g., background-color: rbg(0 255 0) => this is the green color. green ratio: 255, red and blue ration: 0
            e.g., background-color: rbg(0 0 255) => this is the red color. blue ratio: 255, green and red ration: 0
            e.g., background-color: rgb(200 10 20) => this is in-between color. the domenant color is 'red'
        3. by color Hex code. 00 => 0, FF/ff => 255
            e.g., background-color: #FF0000. red ration: 255 == FF, green and blue ration: 0 == 00
            e.g., background-color: #CF0030. red ration: hex(FF), green ration: hex(00), blue ratio: hex(30)
    2. background-image: we can add image to the background
        e.g., background-image: url(../imgs/myimg.png)
    3. background-repeat: we can repeat the background-image in 4 different ways
        1. background-repeat: repeat    => this repeats the image in the 2 directions
        2. background-repeat: repeat-x  => this repeats the image in the x direction
        3. background-repeat: repeat-y  => this repeats the image in the y direction
        4. background-repeat: no-repeat => this doesn't repeat the image at all, just put it once.
        Note: If it's not included, the default will be applied
        Note: The default is 'repeat', repeat it in the 2 directions
    4. background-attachment: it can take many values but the critical values are just 2 values
        1. background-attachment: fixed => this make the image fixed in the screen even if you scroll down
        2. background-attachment: scroll=> this make the image scroll. once you scroll down, it disappears
    5. background-position: it takes 2 arguments. if the second argument is missing, it's considered 'center'
        - The page is formed with 3 rows and 3 columns
        - It means that the page is divided into 9 sections e.g., 
            left top        center top      right top
            left center     center center   right center
            left bottom     center bottom   right bottom
        - We can access it into 2 ways
            1. by typing the position e.g., left right
            2. by the px and % e.g., 
                - 40px 0px: move it 40px from left and 0px from top
                - 30px 50%: move it 30px from left and 50% from top
    6. background-size: there are 5 main methods to control the background-size
        1. e.g., background-size: cover;
            - this covers the content of the page whatever happens
            - the image can be stretched or clipped to cover the whole content
            - the resolution of the image is changable, to cover the whole content
        2. e.g., bachground-size: contain;
            - this contains the content which is in the image default resolution
            - the image can be zoomed in/out but the dimensions ratio is fixed
            - some of the content would be visable just to make the dimensions ratio fixed
            - من الاخر الصورة مش بتبوظ
        3. e.g., background-size: auto;
            - this is the default value
            - the image will be as the parent resolution
            - if background-size selector isn't considered, the auto value will be selected
        4. e.g., background-size: 500px 700px;
            - we can control the background-image-size by the pexels
            - the first argument is for width
            - the second argument is for height
        5. e.g., background-size: 50% 30%;
            - we can control the background-image-size by covering content percentage
            - the first argument is for covering the content from the left index
            - the second argument is for covering the content from the top indexs
            - the percentage represents the percentage of covered content
            - out example represents: 
                - the image covers the content from the left by 50%
                - the image covers the content from the top  by 30%
